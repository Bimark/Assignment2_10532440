/*1. Gallant and Goofus swims the same amount of time.
2.Gallant did not swim but Goofus swam for only 1 minute. 
3.Gallant checks the temperature of the water first before swimming.
4.Goofus checks the temperature.
5.While loop performs an action a number of times but do-while loop performs an action for at least once before checking the condition.
6.pre-test loop is the while loop and post-test loop is do-while loop.
